JavaScript (JS) plays a major role in content delivery on the modern Internet.
For the median webpage, research has found that JS code amounts to
nearly half of the bytes transferred [@goel2022jawa],
JS execution time accounts for about half of
the compute delay [@goel2024sprinter], and the content fetched and
rendered from JS presumably occupies the majority of the network and
compute resources on browsers.
In this sense, JS is steering a large portion of the Internet traffic, and
displaying its information in front of end users.

1. How does your research "fit in"? (The competition, from NABC.) 1.
    why is it interesting research (to the field)? 2.
    why is it interesting for you (what will you learn)?3.
    what is relationship to other work (briefly, a few sentences or so,
    ideally with references to prior work or other projects)
-->
However, it remains understudied why this huge amount of JS code is used.
While observations from the industry have argued that most of
the JS transferred is unnecessary [@ceglowski2015website],
<!-- TODO: cite examples. -->
research efforts have focused on its security vulnerabilities and
privacy invasions.
We understand neither the purposes of the use of JS nor its efficiency in
achieving them.

<!-- 1. What need will your research address? -->
Although JS was originally designed for beginners to
script browser interactions [@paolini1994netscape], it has been adopted for
a plethora of systems tasks, which may explain its high resource usage.
For example, as the popularity of Single-Page Applications (SPAs)
[@oh2013automated] rose, many websites that could otherwise be served as
static HTML instead ship entire SPA frameworks, fetch JSON data from
the server, and convert them into DOM elements.
If we can identify common use of JS,
we may better inform developers interested in optimizing their websites,
improve general online browsing experience, and
utilize Internet bandwidths when serving Web content.

<!--
I would like to study why so much JS is used, its usage patterns,
functionalities, developer intentions and their potential mismatches with
actual deployment.
As a first step, I would like to analyze the JS code on websites and
infer whether they are for frontend processing, content generation,
extensional features (e.g., auth and analytics), boilerplate, or
other purposes.
I hope to get a deeper understanding of what people use JS for, which
may inform future utilization of the Internet and designs for the Internet to
serve content.

1. What research you plan to do (briefly, a paragraph or so).
    (What is approach, from NABC.)
Top 1000 sites.
1. What do you expect the results of your research to be?
    (What are the benfits, from NABC.)
1. what specific *deliverables* you will have for
    Project B. These must include: 1. meeting once a week with your mentor. 2.
    written weekly notes about your progress (suggested format:
    a Google docs document that you can share).
    This should list: (i) what I accomplished last week, (ii)
    what questions I have and what problems I need help with, (iii)
    what I plan to do next week, (iv) comments from the mentor.
    Each week, please prepare these notes and send them to
    your mentor the night before your meeting, then
    update the notes after the meeting (with answers to your questions and
    any revisions to your plan). 3. what end results you will have.
    Probably some specific code, or measurement.
    Probably including some specific experiment or analysis. 4.
    That you will do a Project B report if
    your project proposal is approved and you choose to pursue it.
    The Research Project B report is about 2-6 pages summarizing where
    you are as of the Project B deadline and what (if anything) you plan for
    Research Project C. 5.
    If your Research Project C is approved, that
    you will do a Project C report and an end-of-semester poster.
    A Research Project C report is about 3-8 pages summarizing where
    you are at the end of the semester.
    Research Project C will also have a required poster.
    The poster session will be outside the class time, so
    attendance is optional.
    (We expect to provide support for poster printing; details will follow.)
