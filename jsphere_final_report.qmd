# Weekly Meeting Notes {.unnumbered}

<!-- TODO: add this in private repo. -->

# Introduction
<!-- giving an overview of what need you're trying to address,
what you are doing and plan to do, what the novelty and
new results will be (i.e., why will your work be interesting to others in
the field), and why is this work interesting to you, personally.
Except for the last part (about you), that
structure is roughly like a typical paper. -->

# Related Work
<!-- summarizes prior work related to yours and describes how your work compares.
When you compare to prior work, summarize the prior work and then
identify how it is alike or different from your work.
(Usually, related work is similar to your work in some ways and different in
others.) You need to include complete citations to the prior work
(those citations should point to a bibliography at the end of your report). -->

There have been many user-facing studies on JS.
Researchers have studied how to detect privacy-invading or
malicious intention in JS, such as tracking when
user data flow towards the server [@li2018jsgraph],
identifying browser APIs associated with advertisements and
tracking [@snyder2016browser],
identifying fingerprinting behaviors [@iqbal2021fingerprinting], and,
most recently, detecting techniques for malicious code to
evade observations [@pantelaios2024fv8].
Besides privacy and security, researchers have also invented techniques to
improve the performance bottlenecks brought by JS, such as
speeding up webpage load time by executing JS in
parallel [@mardani2021horcrux], or reducing JS execution during web crawling by
imitating their effects on previously-visited webpages [@goel2024sprinter].
These studies have provided insights into how to solve some of the issues of
JS and improve user experiences.

There are, however, no research focusing on identifying the purposes of
general JS to the best of our knowledge.
JSphere aims to bridge this gap of understanding about the use of JS in
general.
Instead of working around the JS issues, we aim to understand the root cause;
instead of focusing on script intentions centering around privacy and security,
we focus on the ordinary use of JS on webpages.
By looking into the common use of ordinary JS, we hope to
provide insights into avoiding JS issues in the first place and
improving web browsing experiences.

# Goals
<!-- listing what your goals were from Research Projects A and B with
a statement about which goals you completed, and for those you didn't complete,
why you didn't complete them.
Possible Reasons may vary from "ran out of time" or "unable to get access to
data" to "decided with mentor that result Y was more interesting than
result X"; you may have other reasons as well.
You should also list any goals you added after you submitted Project B, and
annotate these as "additional".

(This section is the only one that would not appear in a real paper.) -->

# JSphere
<!-- Section 4 A discussion of your work.
You will likely want to use multiple sections or subsections here, and
you should identify your goal, methodology/approach, data collection, and
results. -->

# Future Work
<!-- You are not required to actually do this work, but it's always good to
identify where the work might go, especially since
the project work might not have perfectly aligned with the semester deadline. -->

# References {.unnumbered}
<!-- Section 6 A bibliography, with at least what you cite in related work -->
